AM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\nBy Anne-Marie Slaughter\nPRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is\ntightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and\nsteadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone\nwhile the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab\nLeague have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-\nflight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.\nIt's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \"Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United\nStates\" and that while Americans \"want to support democratic movements in the region,\" they are\nalready doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab\npopulations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our\nprofessions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new\nbeginning in the Muslim world — a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide\nservices and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for\nterrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.\nIt will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director\ngeneral, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming\nfrom Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into\nQaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But\nthese arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition\nfighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by\nsome of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of\nforeign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\ndemocrats.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nIt won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping\nColonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\noffer of a negotiated departure.\nIf it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\nLet's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\n'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739568\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And the creation of an anti-Islamic video\n(ironically entitled \"Innocence of Muslims\") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst\n(or excuse) for the protests.\nWhy Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed\nMost Americans operate by a different \"we.\" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly\nattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.\nLibyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, \"I\ncondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free\npeople everywhere.\"\n\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the\nInternet,\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. \"The United States deplores any intentional effort to\ndenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning\nof our nation.\"\nIn a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as\"This Is Water,\" novelist David\nFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the \"natural, basic self-centeredness\" that puts \"me\" at the center of\nthe world.\nThis unconscious \"default setting\" fosters the sort of \"blind certainty\" that manifests as arrogant atheism and\nfundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that \"default setting\" — to\nbegin to see things from the perspectives of others.\nFollow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739590\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It was made by anAmerican.\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\nprotests turned deadly, condemning \"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\nCNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \"Innocence of Muslims\" are imprisoned in some\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\nTheir film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\ndupes.\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\nas \"Sam Bacile\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"Islam is a cancer.\"\nYou don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\nand you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\nreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than\noffending them with an ignorant movie.\nNonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as \"blind certainty.\"\nOur world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and\nHindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.\nNeither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.\nThe real \"red line\" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent\ndays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of\ninnocents in Libya and Egypt.\nBoth groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of \"blind certainty,\" unacquainted with both the complexity and\ncontradictions of life on Earth and the \"cloud of unknowing\" that hovers over every major religion.\nThe great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not\nknow everything.\nThey knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of\nordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying\nthe world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.\nThe killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence\nof Islam.\"\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739590\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert\nto the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans,\nin an effort to encourage additional defections.\n(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to\nsummarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzu•\nhas reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was\nthe commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in\nN'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of\n1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops.

One rebel source\nreported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown, Sirte, anticipating\nits capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a\npsychological blow for Qaddall.)\nSeparately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a\ncomplete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who\nhave experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan\ntroops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.\nThis source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are\nreports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan\nleader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have\nbeen unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge\nfrom this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.\nSarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting\nGroups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.\nAccordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6\nnations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist\ngroups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the\nMuslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.\nThese sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following\nrebel figures in Benghazi:\nMESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan\nleaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France;\n.Gehan (GI-LEI-LAND Abdallah (colonel);\nCHARRA.NT Faraj,\nBOUKHRIS Fathi,\nGeneral Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces)\n(Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libya,\nand elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. These\nofficials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya, France and other western European countries must move\nquickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small, semi- autonomous\nlocal entities—or \"Caliphates\"—in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.)\nThese knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi:\n82 and 120 mm. mortars;\nGPZ type machine guns;\n12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles;\nsome anti-aircraft batteries type ZSU 23/2 and 23/4 as well as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems\n(MANPADS) type SAM?;\nsome tanks type T-72;\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739594\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

But [the Romney campaign] will try to\npaint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\"\nHe said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a\nhelpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed\nattempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. \"They are so excited about it,\" he said. \"Over\nand over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is\ngoing to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.\"\nThe source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. \"To me, it is indicative that they have lost\ntouch with a huge portion of the electorate,\" he said.\nThe source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present.

He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\noperation.\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\nSeptember 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya\n\"inexplicable\" and added that Obama is \"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief.\" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \"I am astonished,\" Rove said. \"We are projecting weakness\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"This\nis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the\nmost transparent in history,\" he told Fox News. \"And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of\ncover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\nAmericans.\"\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"I think it's because they have this\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist\nterrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\nconvenient narrative.\"\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to\n\"the terrorist attack\" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"I think they want to do their very best to\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\" Romney said.\nAdded Ryan, \"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.\"\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were\ndivided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"a huge gift\" to the campaign. \"Across the board —\ndomestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,\" he\nsaid. \"He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.\"\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\nthe central issue. \"They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic\nprospects are not very good and all that,\" the aide told Politico. \"Well, Romney's been trying to do that\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and he's failed. The president is better at\ndeflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on\nindividual voters.\"\nCraig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \"House of Bush, House of Saud,\" and a\nfrequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC's Today Show and\nother broadcast outlets.

Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I'm biased.\nMitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East\nRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.\nDisturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim\nBrotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.\nembassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all\nthe while promising to annihilate Israel.\nThese developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"bumps in the road.\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.\nYet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\nour allies.\nAnd that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be\npulled into the maelstrom.\nWe still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\nThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not\nthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\ntrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\nBut in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"recovery\" that barely deserves the name. Our national\ndebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\nFinally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\nBy failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\nHe does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\nThe Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\ngrave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\nweeks\nThe same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"daylight\" between our two\ncountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"closest ally\" in the Middle East to being only \"one of our closest allies.\" It's a diplomatic message that will\nbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \"noise\" that he prefers to \"block out.\" And at a time when\nIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nIn this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who\nshare our values.\nThis means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,\nthe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.\nIt means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for\nthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to\nextremism.\nBut this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of\nour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739629\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Gelb\nA diplomat under fire.\nWith the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately\nsearching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan\nRice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk\nshows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was \"spontaneous\"\nrather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a\nMormon.\nOut came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous\nevent. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key\nintelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was\njust covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed\nHillary Clinton as secretary of State.\nThe commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the\nwall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,\npledged to \"investigate\" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the\nend of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739637\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nNow, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did\nnot make up the \"spontaneous\" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.\nShe got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel\nreports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more\nor less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim\nfigures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher\nStevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the\ninevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.\nHer mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made\nthe same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the\nintelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information\nwould appear soon enough. It always does.\nSure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the\ncommunications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort\nout facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is\nnow taking shape.\nMeantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with\nSenator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now\nof Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes\nher, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly\ninaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging\nObama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739637\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our\nview that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the\ninvestigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what\ntranspired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.\" But she got pushed\nthere.\nWaiting on other transcripts.\nFor more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan\nRice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.\nRICE: Good to be with you, Jake.\nTAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at\nthe consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some\npeople involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the\nlatest information?\nRICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and\nwill take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.\nBut our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what\nthis began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In\nCairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this\nvery offensive video that was disseminated.\nWe believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,\nrather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to\nhave been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,\nweapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and\naccessible. And it then evolved from there.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739704\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWe'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at\npresent.\nTAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound\nin Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?\nRICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...\nTAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?\nRICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who\nwere killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other\ncolleagues who were doing the same with them.\nIt obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that\nmoment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the\npresident has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the\ngovernments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and\nwe're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...\nTAPPER: But why...\nRICE: ... and where needed.\nTAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this\n-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in\nprevious months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?\nRICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every\nfacility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,\nas in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of\nmonths.\nBut I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security\npresence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a\nplace where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State\nDepartment thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether\nwhat was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.\nBut the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will\nremain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739704\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does\nthe U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab\ncountries than it was four years ago?\nRICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know\non what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...\nTAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.\nRICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this\nweek in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...\nTAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...\nRICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that\nthe U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.\nWe have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have\ncondemned it in the strongest possible terms.\nBut let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the\ngovernments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And\nas soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.\nPresident Morsi...\nTAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.\nRICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off --\nand his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.\n(CROSSTALK)\nRICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the\ngovernment has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what\nhas happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their\nrevolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated\nanti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the\noutpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government\nof Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection\nof the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739704\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nTAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you\nbrought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked\nabout the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nOBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They\nare a new government that is trying to find its way.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nTAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few\ndecades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO\nally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?\nRICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a\nvery critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the\npresident wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...\nTAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?\nRICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the\npresident had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored\nthat it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel\nand facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic\nsteps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly\nmade a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the\nmessage that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against\nthe United States or other Western partners.\nSo what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly\nmeasured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured\nthat in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come\nout and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of\nTurkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for\nviolence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United\nStates personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.\nTAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge\nPresident Morsi, \"Get your act together\"?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739704\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant\nmilitary advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed \"Operation Mermaid Dawn,\" the\ntiming gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up\nactivity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently\npromoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,\ndown almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than\nthe authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for\nTripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely\nmanner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC\njust issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human\nrights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward\nthinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not\nWhile there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have\ntranslated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two\nhours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than\nhead any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance\nhere. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli\nfall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,\nwhich after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of\nhow to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do\nthe extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for\nTripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to\nthe military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)\npassing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support\nthere and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an\nalternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to\nremind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum\nthat others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.\nWe've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the\nbest solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote\nand how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and\nacts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even\nmore than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility\ncould be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would\nunderscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the\nBenghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They\nfeel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no\nmatter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that\nthe TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same\ncategory as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739732\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Tarhouni also\nacknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and\nnot a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,\nMohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is\nprepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla\nwar could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.\nAmong other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the\nreconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less\nlikely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through\nrule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained\nas part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC\nofficials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an\ninclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still\nseem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the \"gentle character\" of the Libyan people as the\nbest assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.\nBenghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation\ncommittees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension\nand gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had\npreviously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are\nnow looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and\npillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance\nto Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National\nSecurity Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist\nleanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people\nnoted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,\nagain, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was\nwidespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here\nwhen I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.\nWe also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as\nmore territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns\nor fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to\ndiscuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on\nSouth Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa\nproblem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making\nNelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out\nattending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the\nUAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way\nof getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the\nU.S. interagency process.\nMy traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.\nI will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril\nagain in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role\napproaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I\nneed to join Chris here in the coming days.\nChris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all\nthe work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in\nestabliishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team.

The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and\napproved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts\nboth generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom\ntouched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many\nmentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national\naction plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement\nthem. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional\nconflict (I will tell Morningstar).

One vehicle was also burned at the compound.\nFor many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest\nproblems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the\nmultiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the\nregular armed forces and police.\nThe militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's\nrevolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals\nand carrying out killings.\nMilitias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their\nhardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which\nkilled Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\nAfter taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist\nmilitia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were\nwounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.\nEarlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on\nFriday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.\n\"No, no, to militias,\" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that\nmilitias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. \"Benghazi is in a trap,\"\nsigns read. \"Where is the army, where is the police?\"\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739766\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nOther signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, \"The ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya lost a friend.\"\nMilitary helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the\nprotesters.\nThe march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of\nQaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been\nunable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled\nthe growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.\nResidents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.\nThe anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of\nBenghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a\ndeadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.\nA significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.\nDuring the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and\nally itself with Al Qaeda.\nBut now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.\n\"The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,\" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim\npreacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio\nshow he hosts. \"We felt that the revolution is going in vain.\"\nLeaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias\ndisband.\nTribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no\nlonger have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are\nkilled.\nActivists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put\nan end to the \"state of terrorism\" created by the militias.\nMilitiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of\nelderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,\nreportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and\nassassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.\nDarna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.\nWomen wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In\nthe ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare\nWestern songs.\nAnd many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name\nmeans \"Supporters of Shariah Law.\"\n\"We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,\" said Wassam ben\nMadin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising\nagainst Qaddafi. \"This is not the time for talk about Sharjah.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\n\"If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?\" he said. \"We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over\nheads,\" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.\nOne elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, \"We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell\nthem you are from us and you fought for us\" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into\nthe) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.\"\nOfficials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The\narmed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.\nSo the government has created a \"High Security Committee\" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to\nintegration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average\npolice monthly salary of around $200.\nHowever, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only\nprompted more militias to form.\nOfficials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war\nagainst Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several\nhundred thousand.\n\"All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,\" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The\ngovernment is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.\"\n###\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739766\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a\nmajor transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this\none to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation\nwith military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.\nThe resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair\ncame to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,\ncreates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of\nnon-military approaches.\nWhen he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President\nGeorge W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was\nreflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,\nObama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man\ncould offer him.\nPetraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a\nmilitary solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed\nwith Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy\napproach.\nWith the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned\nabout the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to\npay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739802 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nDate: 05/13/2015 SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nthe troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this\npresident: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.\nBut such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military\nanswer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and\ncultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special\nops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the\nsame old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to\nemploy which tactics to defeat the enemy?\nWhat atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the\nother tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and\nlegal leverage.\nPerhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating\nlack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was\nstunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.\nofficials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular\ngovernment. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.\nThe first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core\nfunction: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the\nsecretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone\nin the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining\nan intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at\nthe helm of the CIA.\nAnother main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of\ntransition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign\npolicy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,\nadaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be\nattracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.\nBut the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death\nof Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive\nways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.\nStevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the\nregion to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment\nand helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically\nuntenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.\nAnd faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a\nsecretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.\nPerhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,\nrestructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the\ncurrent crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.\nSarah Chayes, former special assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. of Staff is a resident associate at the\nCarnegie Endowment and a contributing writer to Opinion.\nUNCLASSIFar\nEtiVright 2012, Los Angeles Times\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739802 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nDate: 05/13/2015 SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.\n11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on\nthe anniversary.\nThe focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack\nObama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.\nRice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: \"As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to\nappear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were\nprimarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American\ndiplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program.\"\nHours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-\nIslamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith\nand two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.\nRice said, \"The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this\" pattern.\n\"When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to\nme by the intelligence community,\" she said.\n\"I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,\"\nshe added.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739811\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his family\nand those who have suffered in this attack.\nThis evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect\nAmericans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and\npledged his government's full cooperation.\nSome have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted\non the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs\nof others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\nBut let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\nIn light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries\naround the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.\nStatement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in\nBenghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens\nand Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of\nkin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and\ncolleagues.\nA 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he\nsustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.\nI had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke\neloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This\nassignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer\nties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps\nVolunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans\non the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to\nbuild the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work\nthat he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when\nthat meant putting himself in danger.\nSean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,\nMontreal, and most recently The Hague.\nAll the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this\nvicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan\npeople reach for a better future.\nAmerica's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.\nWe are honored by the service of each and every one of them.\nRemarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 12, 2012\nYesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants\nassaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel\nbattled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign\nService information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are\nstill making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.\nThis is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We\ncondemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the\nfamilies, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.\nAll over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in\nthe service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a\nforce for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing\nfor. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and\ngenerous nation.\nIn the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line\nof duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this\ntragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.\nChris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching\nEnglish in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America\nin distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.\nHe arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with\nLibya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a\nbetter Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,\nand told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nSean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\nfinally to Benghazi.\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\nToday, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group —\nnot the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\nLibyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\ntrue and lasting peace.\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a\ngreat deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet\nfinished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world\ncontinues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 13, 2012\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\nGlen.\nTyrone's friends and colleagues called him \"Rone,\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\nTyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\nmonths ago.\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and\nunstinting valor.\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\nworld. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We\nappreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\nviolence.\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\ncontent and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\ndiplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\nunderstuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\nnote that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\ncivil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\nriot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\nfuture.\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\nearlier this year. I told my team: \"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\" No\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\nlongstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\nthemselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nopen and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans — men and women alike —\nrespected.\nI'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of\nchild marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\nthis issue.\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\ntoward resolution.\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially\namong young people.\nThat's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\nToday, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and\nMorocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\nbenefits for Moroccans.\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And so we are\npartnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.\nThere will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly\nappreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your\nsupport for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new\ndemocratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial\nmeeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely\ntogether as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.\nFinally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th\nanniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.\nThere are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr.\nBenjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from\npreserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue.\nIn these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great\nchallenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\nour nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\" I'm\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\nstronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for\nthe world.\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to\nwork with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your\ndistinguished delegation.\nThank you.

They were good and\nbrave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of\nLibya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\nambassador.\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\nAMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\nthe intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\ntheir faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWhen all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\nresort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\nothers, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\none's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.\nBut that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of\nwhat makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in\nour future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us\nmoving forward in a positive direction.\nSo tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,\nbut also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are\ndoing to help shape that better future.\nTwo years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation\nChange to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I\nasked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to\nhelp build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you\ntonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young\nleaders, each with a powerful story to tell.\nThe Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building\nan international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.\nThey act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when\nneeded. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual\nunderstanding and respect, one person at a time.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages\nyoung people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young\npeople from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a\ndifferent background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but\nanother real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with\nwhom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.\nPeople of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all\ntraditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better\nunderstanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from\ntonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,\nfrankly, for us who are older as well.\nLet me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these\nefforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.\nAnd from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top\npriority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of\nRemarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya\nSeptember 14, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,\nSecretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the\nfour patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and\ngentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our\nvalues. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and\ndeepest gratitude.\nSean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an\nexpert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled\nin correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a\nloving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,\nfriends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that\nSean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners\nwho shared his passion.\nTyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple\ntours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in\ndangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East.

Glen deployed to some of the\nmost dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the\nline to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his\nmother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and\ncolleagues.\nI was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who\nare here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave\nus. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States\nin far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he\nrisked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them\nbuild a better country.\nPeople loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.\nHe was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense\nof fun and that California cool.\nIn the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the\nUnited States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young\nwoman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said\n\"Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,\" The President of the Palestinian\nAuthority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter\nremembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — \"an act of ugly terror.\"\nMany others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.\nThis has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the\nheavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage\nand violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to\ndo with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is\ntotally unacceptable.\nThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the\ntyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do\neverything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And\nwe will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the\nworld.\nThere will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the\nfundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to\ncontinue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the\nState Department.

And we will\ndo it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always\ndid. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to\nbless the United States of America.\nAnd now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department\nearlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were\ndoing for our country. The President of the United States.\nRemarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their\nMeeting\nSeptember 18, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to\nwelcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished\ndelegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the\nhighest levels of each of our governments.\nBefore I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.\nresponse to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are\ntaking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That\nincludes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And\nwe are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who\nmurdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.\nThe FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing\nmore important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the\nsame time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight\nhow important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the\nworld. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they\nknow that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and\nsacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.\nNow, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to\ndiscuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends\nas well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can\nimagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we\nfocused on a top priority for us both a security.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nWe just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative\nGroup. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer\nmy personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their\nleadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our\ngovernments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative\nrepresents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.\nAs our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal\norganizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent\ngangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy\nway to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now\nnearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.\nWe have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies\nwho have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we\nhave built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time\nto come.\nToday, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving\nlaw enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border\ninfrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered\ncommunities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these\nand other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our\nsecurity relationship with Mexico is to the United States.\nThe Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these\ncriminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to\nsupport Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational\nproblem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of\nshared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to\nMexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are\nsafe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.\nNow, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and\ngirls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender\nequality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.\nSo again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive\nconversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable\ncolleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and\nthe ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We believe strongly that presidential administrations may\nchange, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation\nthat has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our\ncountries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.\nQUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed\nAmbassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you\nconfident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to\nthe Libyans?\nSECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our\npeople and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security\nposture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-\nneeds are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,\ncolleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside\nLibya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.\nIt is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.\nIn a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists\nwho are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,\nwe have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to\ntrade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the\nfuture to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong\npartnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual\nrespect.\nThis is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in\ntheir first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in\nall of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in\norder to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American\nfacilities.\nAnd as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist\nefforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as\nto the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put\nthemselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against\nviolence, whoever incites it or conducts it\nAnd in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support\nthose who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And I want to\nunderscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and\naround the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that\nthey experienced can be realized.\nAnd finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about\nsecurity at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our\nsecurity in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard\nforce of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security\noutside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.\nAnd with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we\ndid an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has\nsaid we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or\nimminent.\nBut let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature\nof diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but\nto also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what\nwe do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every\nsingle day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols\nreflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.\nThank you.\nRemarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana\nNatalegawa After Their Meeting\nSeptember 20, 2012\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to\nwelcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come\nfrom Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.\nThis commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,\nand the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States\nand Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to\nclean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.\nAnd today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time\nof the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very\nimpressed. We covered a great deal today.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nBut before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the\nworld. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from\nthese protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and\nreprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\nBut there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his\ngovernment for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and\nresponsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of\nthis moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.\nToday's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of\nour most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm\nannouncing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight\nAH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will\nstrengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.\nOn growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last\nyear. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting\neconomic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone\nrepresents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half\na trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.\nAnd yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge\nCorporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600\nmillion in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help\nmake Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.\nThe United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are\nconfident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic\nintegration across the Asia Pacific.\nBoth the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem\nglobal economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and\nsupported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic\nexchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the\nUnited States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education\nprogram to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.\nAnd we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The Foreign Minister's\npersonal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as\nit relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,\nwhich we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of\nconduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.\nFinally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,\nfrom democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence\nin Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular\ncooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on\nwomen's empowerment.\nWe believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and\nIndonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last\nfour years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic\ntransitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And\nonce again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.\nSo, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between\nus and between our countries.\nMS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera\nEnglish.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my\nquestion is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.\nYou are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the\nconcerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an\naccountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there\ncertain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of\nForeign Service Officers around the world?\nAnd related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are\nyou satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in\nthe Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of\nrumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt\nthat he was on a, quote, \"al-Qaida hit list\" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor\nwhen one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to\nwhat he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in\na classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and\nwith governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be\njoined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary\nof Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,\nalong with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.\nNow, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,\nand the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our\npeople and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the\nintelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the\nsuperb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the\nvery early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.\nAnd I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be\nchaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.\nI will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of\nthe events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,\nthese fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries\ndid not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are\nconcerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the\ninternal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and\nchildren of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore\nsecurity and civil order.\nAnd let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.\nWe continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work\nin Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal\nrights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where\nthat person might live.

If it's continuing happen, it's —\nobviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is\nthe reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your\nexpectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia\nGovernment respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. —\nIndonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)\nprogram implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent\ncooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law\nenforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the\ncooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong\nstatements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.\nIn consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed\nour facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it\nneeds to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are\ncooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.\nFOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.\nPrecisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close\ntemporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made\nbased on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United\nStates as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to\nshow any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some — it's the\nkind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.\nSome of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the\nembassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is\nactually coordinated as well.\nBut if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,\nIndonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone\nthe — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because\nthat is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among\nstates. So that's our point of departure.\nAt the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have\nstill ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other\nsettings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral\nrelationship as well as regional and global issues.\nI want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again\nseen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned\nviolent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their\nefforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.\nAnd I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot\nbe tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have\ncertainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at\nthe core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.\nBut that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible\nleaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and\nparticularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own\nextremist ideologies.\nYesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people\neverywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist\nattack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who\nmurdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect\nour staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important\ncontributions to the work of our missions.\nThe Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no\nsecret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And\nwe still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,\nbut we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\ntoday is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just\nreturned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week\nat the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we\nshare — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.\nOur number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure\nthe security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common\nenemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated\nthe Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every\navailable legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for\nexpelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani\nGovernment and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.\nAnd the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working\nwith Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a\nsecure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I\nwant to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow\nthe movement of goods to Afghanistan.\nWe will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad\nwhich brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process\nin Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk\nwith the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build\non these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-\nAfghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.\nNow, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will\ndiscuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic\nopportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic\nrelationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more\nprivate sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've\ncreated a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium\nsized companies get access to capital.\nOver the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger\nroots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's\nhistory that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports\nPakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy\nsucceed in Pakistan.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from\nTunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I\nwant to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last\nweek to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the\nviolent assaults of last Friday.\nWe are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and\nmyself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to\naugment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely\nwith host governments in this effort.\nAs I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international\nagreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.\nThey must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on\nmany important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting\nviolence and holding violent actors accountable.\nWe are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the\nsecurity of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice\nthose responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for\nways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout\ntheir country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to\ncontinuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our\nrelationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to\nnonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.\nThe Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first\nof the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.\nThey have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress\nhijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.\n,\n,encia. And those extreinists, not only in\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We\nalso are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from\ngroups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.\nSo Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal\nwith this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with\nyou as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the\nfuture of Tunisia.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739812\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

A25\nHEADLINE: It's not about Rice\nBYLINE: Richard Cohen\nBODY:\nIn 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a\nleftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in\nWashington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was \"soft on communism,\" and he launched an\ninvestigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his\nday.\nRice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's\nand a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having\ndone - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more\nat work.\nAt first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his\nRumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn\ncharge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\nShe had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.\nBut Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were\nwrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.\nJust as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It\nwas soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a\npost to which she has not been nominated. \"Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or\nincompetently misled the American public,\" they bellowed.\nI think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great\ndeal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some\nothers. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential\nsecretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who\nhas, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is\nchairman.\nBut the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White\nHouse and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739841\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\njob at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most\npart, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.\nSo what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease\nabout Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's\nalleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else\n(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of\nunhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an\namorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.\nSyria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be\ndusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,\nbut much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee\ncalamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna\nadministration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.\nThis sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much\nmore than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He\nsees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for\nintervention, not just say it's too hard to do.\nThe attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this\ncase, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American\npower, not merely American politics.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739841\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Sid\nB6\nhttp://www.juancole.com/2012/12/benghazis-criticizes-consular.ht I\nBenghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for\nAttacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security\nPosted on 12/19/2012 by Juan\nThe report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc\nconsulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The\n\"consulate\" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not\nconstructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.\nI met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even\nclear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,\ndepending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for\nembassy security funds).\nThe more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate\nduring and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is\nresponsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on\nthe consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a\ncountry of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1\ne'as the epicenter of the revolution against the\ngovernment of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.\nOn November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel\nbarely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in\nSeptember. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but\nhad defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of\nhardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same\nshadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army\nofficers.\nThere may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected\ngovernment in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the\nviolence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep\nThroat.\nDeep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those\nhatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.\nOn Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is\nbeing detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called\nfor back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.\nStill, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in\ncustody, with all his valuable testimony.\nShortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police\nstation in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then\nexplosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in\ncasualties.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739848\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,\na senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7\nprominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police\nnamed 6 explicitly:\n1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at\nGuantanamo\n2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia\n3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia\n4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia\n5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati\n6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade\nIt is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he\ndid so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there\nis collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.\nThe new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the\ncountry's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house\ncleaning to do in Benghazi.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739848\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\nLet me know your thoughts:\nSOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of\nEuropean Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.\n1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close\nadvisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the\ngovernment of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil\nrealizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical\nexperts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist\nmovement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues\nto complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no\nconfidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering\ndelaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.\n2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary\nunderstanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the\nNTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding\nwho has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012,\nno decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes\nthey can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a\nsensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist\nmovement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib's future depends on Jalil's\nopinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)\n3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib's\ncabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security\nsituation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding\npossible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to the\neastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil's point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened\ntension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist\nproblem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil\nMinister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,\nindividuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this\nsource Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.\n4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the\nexisting fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and\ntribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is\ndifficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such\nagreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration\nbefore full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found\nevidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of\nthe Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the\ncountry, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI\nmanagement in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a\nlong time senior official of ENI.\n5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least\nuntil they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his\nproblems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.\n6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring\norder to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading\nopposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC\nmembers will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided\nby members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no\nconfidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent\nassembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739878\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National\nTransitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected\ngovernment; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people\nfollowing the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7\nmillion Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,\nJAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.\n2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel\nRahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a\nfunctioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of\nmilitia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as\nhealthcare.\n3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western\nsecurity officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,\ninternational advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not\nsign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.\n4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation\nshould not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning\ninstitutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a\ndysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re\nIalizes that due to\npronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make\nprogress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are\nrepresentative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in\ntemporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the\nFrench and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious\nconcerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be\nincluded in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the\nsame time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting\nthere. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to\nvote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)\n5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will\neventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to\nmaintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can\nrebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of\nthe country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739882\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali\nTarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been\nunable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000\nsecurity personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.\nIn that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.\nSimilarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre\nfor election materials.\n7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not\nbeen proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set\nup a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the\nGNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to\ndisrupt the elections.

We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all\ntheir families and colleagues.\nA 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on\nour office in Benghazi.\nI had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his\npassion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two\ndecades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a\nPeace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground\nin Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free\nnation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's\nvalues and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.\nSean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten\nyears ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans\nwe lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their\nlives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.\nAmerica's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by\nthe service of each and every one of them.\n1#tit\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739906\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Central Daylight Time\nSubj: Left at the Gate - blog\nMonday, September 14, 2009\nOdds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html>\nEven as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says\nthat he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-\nnuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community\naround the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week\n<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL\nGreen/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.\n\"Hard Rock is the right balance,\" [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. \"Its recognized brand and quality entertainment\nwill attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I\nwant to see it.\"\nOne of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (\"shovel-ready, in the\nground, the day after the award.\")\nAnd thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's\n<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet\nanother virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the\nfinancial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.\nThis is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a\nparticular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece\none step further by coming up with a morning line.\n<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-\nh/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid\nof $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real\nestate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of\ngaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake\ndoesn't hurt either.\nSL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned\nabove. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions\n<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were\npassed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.\nAqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort\nand a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing\nindifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to\nfollow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>\nadds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-\ndisappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached\naccommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to\nlist them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out\nafter failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation\n<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-\n01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney\nGeneral Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her\ninvolvement here is going to help or hurt.\nSteve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad\ngrade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as\nreported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal\n<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.\nHe'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles\n<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite\nsimply, he sometimes comes off as a nut\n<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .\nPenn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.\nBut a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-\nlobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming\noperator with a solid balance sheet\n<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as\ncompetent a job as anyone else.\nR. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good\nluck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things\nhave been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ).

I've followed this case\nTorture on homefront cries out for justice\nComments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article>\nAugust 26, 2009\nBY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist\nThe feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly\ncloser.\nAnd the irony screams out.\nCarol Mann\nOn Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced he would appoint a special\ncounsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals\ncourt at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where\nhe was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated.\nA Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before\nit re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as \"terrorist\" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11,\nIbrahim Parlak's horror began anew.\nSuddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department's\nImmigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan,\na small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace.\nIn 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up.\nIf it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti-\nterrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred\nUpton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail.\nThanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely.\nThe newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder\nlaunched his torture inquiry.\nB5\nThe majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and\nJudge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his\nrelationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member.\nLet's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the\nattorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft\nand Alberto Gonzales.\nThe fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of\nAppeals, one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted \"a staggering 40 percent of the\n136 petitions\" had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore \"the most basic of facts.\"\nEchoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with\nboth clarity and conviction, arguing the government's \"awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our\ncountry.\"\nLike a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own\ncolleagues, and ends by saying, \"I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid,\noverzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the\nwayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak.\"\nParlak's legal team will appeal.\nMeanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts.\nAs he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of\nIbrahim Parlak.","ExtractedTo":"'cheryl.mills 'sullivanjj@state.gov B6","ExtractedFrom":"H <hrod17@clintonemail.com>","ExtractedCc":"","ExtractedDateSent":"Wednesday, August 26, 2009 10:19 AM"},
